# Musicultured
## A platform for users to interact with their favourite artists, songs, and albums

### Functionality:

- Favorite artists, albums and songs
- View artists

### Challenges:
- Implementing GUI
    - Login page
    - Personal profile
    - Friends profile
    - Threads for each profile
    - Viewing Artist
    - Viewing playlist
    - Viewing songs/ablums
    - Viewing events
- Handling API end-points
    - For all of the events above, interaction leads to some entry in the database (eg: logging in populates a User, adding friends adds friend to a User)
- Developing back-end with Node.js + SQL

### Aspirations:
#### Implementations if we have enough time
- User can login with Spotify and by fetching from the Spotify API, the users' playlists and Top artists/albums are automatically enlisted in the relationship
- Using Spotify API, each Artists' genre, albums, and photo is automatically added to the app
